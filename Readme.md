Certainly! The provided Bash script retrieves the external IP address and prints it. Letâ€™s break down the code:

#!/bin/bash: This line is called a shebang or hashbang. It specifies that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

external_ip=$(wget -q -O - checkip.dyndns.com | grep -Po '[\d.]+'):

wget -q -O - checkip.dyndns.com fetches the content of the URL checkip.dyndns.com.

* The -q flag makes wget operate in quiet mode (no output to the terminal).
* The -O - flag specifies that the output should be sent to standard output (stdout).
* The grep -Po '[\d.]+' command extracts the IP address from the fetched content. It uses Perl-compatible regular expressions (-P) to match digits and dots.


The extracted IP address is stored in the variable external_ip.

echo "External IP address: $external_ip": This line prints the external IP address to the console.
